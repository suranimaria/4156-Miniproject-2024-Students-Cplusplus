- Course.cpp;
    - enrolled num initialized as 500 
    - getters forInstructorName and TimeSlot mixed uo return values
    - wrong check if the course is full
    - drop student function would not ensure the numebr of stduents doesn't go negative
    - enroll student function > check whether there is capacity left

- Department.cpp
    - getDepartmentChair > returned hardcoded string

- RouterController.cpp
    - edge case of not passing any query parameters (dept/course code) not handled => requests would just never terminate
